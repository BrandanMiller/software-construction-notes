Chapter 5: Design In Construction
=================================

Checklist: Design in Construction
---------------------------------

### Design Practices

- Have you iterated, selecting the best of several attempts rather
  than the first attempt?

  + TODO

- Have you tried decomposing the system in several different ways to
  see which way will work best?

  + TODO

- Have you approached the design problem both from the top down and
  from the bottom up?

  + TODO

- Have you prototyped risky or unfamiliar parts of the system,
  creating the absolute minimum amount of throwaway code needed to
  answer specific questions?

  + TODO

- Has you design been reviewed, formally or informally, by others?

  + TODO

- Have you driven the design to the point that its implementation
  seems obvious?

  + TODO

- Have you captured your design work using an appropriate technique
  such as a Wiki, email, flipcharts, digital camera, UML, CRC cards,
  or comments in the code itself?

  + TODO

### Design Goals

- Does the design adequately address issues that were identified and
  deferred at the architectural level?

  + TODO

- Is the design stratified into layers?

  + TODO

- Are you satisfied with the way the program has been decomposed into
  subsystems, packages, and classes?

  + TODO

- Are you satisfied with the way the classes have been decomposed into
  routines?

  + TODO

- Are classes designed for minimal interaction with each other?

  + TODO

- Are classes and subsystems designed so that you can use them in
  other systems?

  + TODO

- Will the program be easy to maintain?

  + TODO

- Is the design lean? Are all of its parts strictly necessary?

  + TODO

- Does the design use standard techniques and avoid exotic,
  hard-to-understand elements?

  + TODO

- Overall, does the design help minimize both accidental and essential
  complexity?

  + TODO
