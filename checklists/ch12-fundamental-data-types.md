Chapter 12: Fundamental Data Types
==================================

Checklist: Fundamental Data
---------------------------

### Numbers in General

- Does the code avoid magic numbers?

- Does the code anticipate divide-by-zero errors?

- Are type conversions obvious?

- If variables with two different types are used in the same expression, will the expression be evaluated as you intend it to be?

- Does the code avoid mixed-type comparisons?

- Does the program compile with no warnings?

### Integers

- Do expressions that use integer division work the way theyâ€™re meant to?

- Do integer expressions avoid integer-overflow problems?

### Floating-Point Numbers

- Does the code avoid additions and subtractions on numbers with greatly different magnitudes?

- Does the code systematically prevent rounding errors?

- Does the code avoid comparing floating-point numbers for equality?

### Characters and Strings

- Does the code avoid magic characters and strings?

- Are references to strings free of off-by-one errors?

- Does C code treat string pointers and character arrays differently?

- Does C code follow the convention of declaring strings to be length constant+1?

- Does C code use arrays of characters rather than pointers, when appropriate?

- Does C code initialize strings to NULLs to avoid endless strings?

- Does C code use strncpy() rather than strcpy()? And strncat() and strncmp()?

### Boolean Variables

- Does the program use additional boolean variables to document conditional tests?

- Does the program use additional boolean variables to simplify conditional tests?
